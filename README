Project Aelith Digital Controller
=================================

An embedded control system targeted to RC model cars which feature individual wheel drive. This controller allows for software differentials and power delivery with the aid of various sensors on the vehicle. Currently the system makes use of wheel speed sensors and a 6 axis IMU for real time processing.

The controller communicates to a steering servo and four brushless DC motor controllers. It also listens to a standard RC radio receiver for user input, as well as a serial port for telemetry over wireless modules such as xbee or bluetooth.

It's hoped that this project allows for advanced features such as traction control, under/over steer detection, adaptive power delivery and real-time telemetry.

The system runs on Cortex M4 STM32F4 devices by ST microelectronics. To build this project, you will need the ARM-GCC compiler found here:

https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

As well as the STLink driver for uploading to a development board such as the STM32F4Discovery board:

To enable debugging, GDB is required and can be found here:

The make.bat file is able to run under Windows to compile, upload and start the debug server. Please ensure that your PATH environment variable are set up in windows for the batch commands to be recognised.


PCB Info
--------

The hardware used in the project is custom. To see the Gerber and Diptrace project files, please see the pcb folder.
Bare boards are available to order at: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/t9Uw3F4U


CAD Designs
-----------

I'll upload full documentation soon on how to modify a Schumacher Mi5 chassis to support four motors, in the meantime, the CAD files for motor mounts, couplings and suspension mounts can be found in the mechanical folder
